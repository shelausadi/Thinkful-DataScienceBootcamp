As an Indonesian citizen who has been living in the United States for a while, I often struggle to keep up with news of what is going on in Indonesia. However, I always make it a point to follow the Indonesian presidential elections because I've always had a keen interest in politics. Before realizing my love for technology, my life's goal was to be the president of Indonesia.

The 2019 Indonesian presidential election was a controversial one. It was a close election between the incumbent, Joko Widodo (Jokowi) and Prabowo Subianto. The result of this election was so close that both candidates declared victory and even though Jokowi eventually claimed victory, there are still protests going on urging a recount of the results months after the election results were announced.

In this project, I used tweets pulled from the Twitter API to perform sentiment analysis on the two candidates to see if it could predict the result of the election.

Steps
Pull public opinion in the form of tweets from the Twitter API
