DRILL: When to use surveys 
State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.

Popularity of various Uber drivers. 
- It makes more sense to take a look at the Uber drivers' average ratings.
A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. 
- A poll in the physical store or email would work better.  
Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. 
- Survey of customers might work since people would be more comforable to discuss sensitive topics in a suvey.
Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going. 
- A survey will work as long as it has the right questions.
Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign. 
-This depends on how we define "success rate".
Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.
-No, a survey will not effectively accomplish this.
